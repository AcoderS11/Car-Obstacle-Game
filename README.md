## Car-Obstacle Game using NEAT AI

This game uses the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm as an AI to "genetically determine" car(s) that successfully navigate through 15 varying patterns of obstacles.

Written using Python 3.9 in the Sublime Text Editor. Game uses Pygame library, OOP Design, and NEAT Algorithm.

Originally created for AP Computer Science Principles Create Task, adapted to use the NEAT algorithm.

### Important Notes and Links

[Link to original NEAT paper](http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/downloads/papers/stanley.cec02.pdf) - excellent resource for an overview on various aspects of the NEAT algorithm, from its focus on augmenting simple neural network structures to details on speciation and crossover.

[Link to NEAT Documentation](https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/neat_overview.html) - Contains a high-level overview of the NEAT algorithm as well as information on installation, configuration file setup for the neural networks, and information on activation functions.

To run this program, you will need to install [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/), neat-python, pygame (ex. using pip):
 ```
 pip install neat-python
 pip install pygame
 ```
