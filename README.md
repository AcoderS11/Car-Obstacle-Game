## Car-Obstacle-Game
user_game.py - Game in which a user-controlled car dodges approaching obstacles with increasing speed as the user moves through 3 levels.

ai_game.py - Instead of a user-controlled car, this game uses the Neuroevolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm as an AI to "genetically produce" a car that successfully moves through 3 levels of varying patterns of obstacles.

Written using Python 3.7.4 in Sublime Text Editor. Game uses Pygame library, OOP Design, and NEAT Algorithm.

Originally created for AP Computer Science Principles Create Task, adapted to use the NEAT algorithm.
